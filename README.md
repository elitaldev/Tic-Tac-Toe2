### **Primary Goal**

To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next playerâ€™s chance.

### **First Time Visitor**

- the game has only one page to navigate.
- A user can access the game using mouse and has to pass the mouse to the next player.
- A user can restart the game using the restart button on the top of the screen.

## Creation Process

we have three files which is html , css and js files.
i created 9 blocks in html file and styled it in css file and make the game work using javascript.

### **1. Strategy**

- First i created an array then i created some functionality for the game.
- The game will start with the X text.
- When a player clicks the button, it will be saved and that button cannot be used again. so O text does not override X text.
- I have added eventlistener to each of my dom elements.
- I have given a each block for one player, that means if current playe, play X the next player can only play O.
- We have a restart button which will restart the game and clear out spaces array.
- i have created winning combination.

### \*\*2. game

### **4. Skeleton**

the game was developed to be simple, clear and easy to play..

## Testing

### **Initial testing plan**

I had planned for this game to be accessible and legible on all screen sizes. I deployed my site halfway through to test on real-world devices. These devices included:

- Acer Aspire 3 Laptop (1920 X 1080)

- iPad Pro 2021
- iPhone SE(2016)
- when it goes smaller than 450px, it won't be responsive.

### **Testing**

Testing took place throughout the entire build using Dev Tools on Chrome and on the above real-world devices. The browsers used were:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

The results of feature testing are as follows:

### **Bugs & Fixes**  
  
| Bug | Section | Fix |
| :----| :----| :--------:|
| I had a problem with the functionality of the game- it was supposed to display "x"'s and "o"'s but it only displayed x's | All pages | After reading through my code I discovered that I was using capital "x"'s and capital "o"'s. This meant that the program would only display "x"'s. Once I had changed the letters to lowercase, the game worked and displayed both "x"'s and "o"'s.   |
| I had problem with winning combination const, I didn't undrestand the whole concept  | Index/Home page | After searching and after my teacher explained to me it became understandable for me.|
| I also had issue with hovering on the restart button | Index/Home page | After searching on w3 school website and going through CSS I was able to fix the problem. |


### **Unsolved Bugs**

- I have a unsolved bug in winnerIndicator, what i was aiming was to have the winner's block to be highlighted when the player win.
but unfortunately i couldn't find a way to fix this.but I will try to find a solution for my future project.
